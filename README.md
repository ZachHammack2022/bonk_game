This is a working version of bonk.io, a popular online physics-based platform game. This was created using pygame, mostly from scratch aside from the collision functions. This environment supports single agent RL using OpenAI gym and Stable Baselines 3(SB3). 

Currently, only one bonk.io env exists, but multiple envs could easily be created. There are options for multiplayer, AI agent vs user, and AI vs AI (same or different models). Tournaments are supported for AI agents only. User cannot interact in tournament yet.
